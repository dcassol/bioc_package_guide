Bioconductor uses the R statistical programming language, and is open source and open development. It has two releases each year, and an active user community. Bioconductor is also available as an AMI (Amazon Machine Image) and Docker images. "],["intro.html", "Chapter 2 Introduction", " Chapter 2 Introduction The Bioconductor project promotes high-quality, well documented, and interoperable software. These guidelines help to achieve this objective; they are not meant to put undue burden on package authors, and authors having difficultly satisfying guidelines should seek advice on the bioc-devel mailing list. Package maintainers are urged to follow these guidelines as closely as possible when developing Bioconductor packages. General instructions for producing packages can be found in the Writing R Extensions manual, available from within R (RShowDoc(\"R-exts\")) or on the R web site. Remember these are the minimum requirements for package acceptance and the package will still be subject to other guidelines below and a formal technical review by trained Bioconductor package reviewer.
