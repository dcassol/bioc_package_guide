Bioconductor uses the R statistical programming language, and is open source and open development. It has two releases each year, and an active user community. Bioconductor is also available as an AMI (Amazon Machine Image) and Docker images. "],["intro.html", "Chapter 2 Introduction", " Chapter 2 Introduction The Bioconductor project promotes high-quality, well documented, and interoperable software. These guidelines help to achieve this objective; they are not meant to put undue burden on package authors, and authors having difficultly satisfying guidelines should seek advice on the bioc-devel mailing list. Package maintainers are urged to follow these guidelines as closely as possible when developing Bioconductor packages. General instructions for producing packages can be found in the Writing R Extensions manual, available from within R (RShowDoc(\"R-exts\")) or on the R web site. Remember these are the minimum requirements for package acceptance and the package will still be subject to other guidelines below and a formal technical review by trained Bioconductor package reviewer.

Depending on the R release cycle, using Bioconductor devel may or may not involve also using the devel version of R. See the how-to on using devel version of Bioconductor for up-to-date information. 3.2 Correctness, Space and Time 3.2.1 R CMD build Bioconductor packages must minimally pass R CMD build (or R CMD INSTALL --build) and pass R CMD check with no errors and no warnings using a recent R-devel. Authors should also try to address all errors, warnings, and notes that arise during build or check.1 3.2.2 BiocCheck Packages must also pass BiocCheck::BiocCheckGitClone() and BiocCheck::BiocCheck() with no errors and no warnings. The BiocCheck package is a set of tests that encompass Bioconductor Best Practices. Every effort should be made to address any notes that arise during this build or check.2 3.2.3 File names Do not use filenames that differ only in case, as not all file systems are case-sensitive. 3.2.4 Package size The source package resulting from running R CMD build should occupy less than 5 MB on disk. 3.2.5 Check duration The package should require less than 10 minutes to run R CMD check --no-build-vignettes. Using the --no-build-vignettes option ensures that the vignette is built only once.3 3.2.6 Memory Vignette and man page examples should not use more than 3 GB of memory since R cannot allocate more than this on 32-bit Windows. 3.2.7 Individual file size For software packages, individual files must be &lt;= 5MB. This restriction exists even after the package is accepted and added to the Bioconductor repository. 3.2.8 Undesirable files The raw package directory should not contain unnecessary files, system files, or hidden files such as .DS_Store, .project, .git, cache files, log files, *.Rproj, *.so, etc. These files may be present in your local directory but should not be commited to git (see .gitignore). 3.3 R CMD check environment It is possible to activate or deactivate a number of options in R CMD build and R CMD check. Options can be set as individual environment variables or they can be listed in a file. Descriptions of all the different options available can be found here. Bioconductor has chosen to customize some of these options for incoming submission during R CMD check. The file of utilized flags can be downloaded from Github. The file can either be placed in a default directory as directed here or can be set through environment variable R_CHECK_ENVIRON with a command similar to: export R_CHECK_ENVIRON = &lt;path to downloaded file&gt; 3.4 README file If a README file is included in the package or the GitHub repository and it provides installation instructions, those instruction should also include Bioconductor installation instructions. If a README.Rmd is provided (rather than README.md, or other) those installation instructions should be in an eval=FALSE code chunk. Nowhere in the code (R code, man pages, vignettes, Rmd files) should someone try to install or download system dependencies, applications, packages, etc. Developers can provide instructions to follow but not executed and should assume all necessary dependencies, applications, or packages are already set up on a user’s system. The Bioconductor team member assigned to review the package during the submission process will expect all ERROR, WARNINGS, and NOTES to be addressed. If there are any remaining, a justification of why they are not corrected will be expected.↩︎ The Bioconductor team member assigned to review the package during the submission process will expect all ERROR, WARNINGS, and NOTES to be addressed.

Experiment Data, Annotation, and Workflow packages are allowed additional space and check time.↩︎ "],["methods.html", "Chapter 4 Methods", " Chapter 4 Methods We describe our methods in this chapter.
